# Pet_Shelter_Implementing_BST
The purpose of this code is to allow the workers of a pet shelter to use the
binary tree search to keep track of what animals are in the shelter. The BST
easily looks up animals by name. This program creates a binary tree by first inserting items,
it can then search for animals, and traverse through them.
It also has function to find the parent of a root, find the
inorder successor of a root, find the number of nodes in our BST, 
find the number of leaf nodes, find the number of nodes at a 
specified level, find the height of our BST, checks is the BST
is balanced, deletes specified nodes, and destorys the whole BST.
